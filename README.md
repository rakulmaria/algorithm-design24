# Algorithm Design

In this repository you will find my proposed solutions to the mandatory Kattis exercises from the course in [Algorithm Design](https://learnit.itu.dk/local/coursebase/view.php?ciid=1487) taught at the IT-University of Copenhagen in autumn 2024. The course is an advanced course on algorithms which builds on top of an introductory course on algorithms and data structures. The course focuses on advanced techniques for identifying and solving computationally hard problems and on how to adapt such techniques to real-world scenarios. In particular, this was done by covering various algorithmic problems in form of [Kattis exercises](https://itu.kattis.com/courses/KSALDES1KU/KSALDES1KU-2024), and then creating a solutions to that particular problem.

The solutions for the different problems can be found in each corresponding folder.
